        <h1>Developing Amazon Recommendations</h1>

        <p>In this project, we are analyzing a dataset of ________ real user reviews in response to food-related purchases from Amazon. From this dataset, we want to develop an accurate method for recommending products for each user based on their past preferences.</p>

    <div class="section" id="section1">
        <h1>Our Data Sources</h1>
        <p>Our data set consists of 568,454 reviews on 74,258 unique, food-related Amazon products, obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews">Kaggle</a>. Each food review includes 10 pieces of information: <b>Id</b>, <b>ProductId, UserId</b>, <b>ProfileName</b>, <b>HelpfulnessNumerator</b>, <b>HelpfulnessDenominator</b>, <b>Score</b>, <b>Time</b>, <b>Summary</b>, and <b>Text</b>. From these reviews, we intend to produce a model for accurately predicting which new products each consumer would be happy with. This model will then be leveraged as a means of suggesting products to users.</p>
        <p>In order to obtain meaningful features for the 74,258 products in the data set, we took advantage of the Amazon API. This API allowed us to look up the given ProductIds and return Product Groups and Ancestor Names, assigned by Amazon. For example, product _[insert id]_ returns product group _[insert]_ and ancestor _[insert]_.</p>
        <!--Id-->
        <!--ProductId - unique identifier for the product-->
        <!--UserId - unqiue identifier for the user-->
        <!--ProfileName-->
        <!--HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful-->
        <!--HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful-->
        <!--Score - rating between 1 and 5-->
        <!--Time - timestamp for the review-->
        <!--Summary - brief summary of the review-->
        <!--Text - text of the review-->

                <h1>Data Exploration</h1>
                <p>We conducted several initial explorations of the dataset in order to develop a better understanding of trends in the data.</p>

                <h1>How People Review Products</h1>
                <p>First, we explored distributions of ratings. This allowed us to learn how sparse the data set was. A data set where every user reviewed a majority of the products and each product would have a large number of reviews would be ideal for modeling, but this will turn out not to be the case. Instead, this is an informative method for understanding what data will have to be filtered out and what data can be used directly from the data set.</p>

                <h2>Score Distribution</h2>
                <img src="img/scores.png">
                <p>Interestingly, a large majority (63.9%) of the ratings given by users across all products are 5 out of 5, while negative ratings (defined as 3 stars or less) constitute only 22% of all ratings.  The heavy skew towards 5 star ratings might present a challenge in distinguishing between products or users.

                <p>Breaking down the users by number of reviews, it's clear that the vast majority of users review very few products. In fact, out of the 256059 unique users, over half of them only have one review! Since it is impossible to create a robust model with only a single data point for each user, we will need to filter for "active users", which we will define as users with greater than _____ reviews.</p>
