        <input type="hidden" name="id" value="1" />
        <p>The Amazon Fine Foods Dataset, collected and distributed by the Stanford Network Analysis Project, contains nearly 600,000 Amazon reviews of over 70,000 food and food-related products by over 250,000 users. With this data, we set out to develop a system for predicting future ratings based on a combination of product features and user characteristics. If successful, such a system could be used to develop an accurate recommendation system.</p>

                <h1>Data Sources:</h1>
                <p>Our data set consists of 568,454 reviews on 74,258 food-related Amazon products by 217468 users. Each review includes UserId, ProductId, Score, and Text, as well as some other values (to see full list, with explanation, click the right arrow).</p>
                <p>In order to obtain meaningful features for the 74,258 products in the data set, we took advantage of the Amazon API. This API allowed us to look up items by the ProductIds and return Product Groups. For example, product _[insert id]_ returns product group _[insert]_.</p>

                <h1>How People Review Products</h1>
                <p>First, we explored distributions of ratings. This allowed us to learn how sparse the data set was. A data set where every user reviewed a majority of the products and each product would have a large number of reviews would be ideal for modeling, but this will turn out not to be the case. Instead, this is an informative method for understanding what data will have to be filtered out and what data can be used directly from the data set.</p>

                <img src="img/scores.png">
                <p>Interestingly, a large majority (63.9%) of the ratings given by users across all products are 5 out of 5, while negative ratings (defined as 3 stars or less) constitute only 22% of all ratings.  The heavy skew towards 5 star ratings might present a challenge in distinguishing between products or users.

                <p>Breaking down the users by number of reviews, it's clear that the vast majority of users review very few products. In fact, out of the 256059 unique users, over half of them only have one review! Since it is impossible to create a robust model with only a single data point for each user, we will need to filter for "active users", which we will define as users with greater than _____ reviews.</p>

Then, we developed a model for determining a products "true" score based on previous reviews by other users. Finally, we developed a method for calculating product similarity by review text, which we were then able to use to estimate user preferences.
